\section{Conclusion}\label{Conclusion}
Cardiac auscultation is a crucial clinical method for detecting heart failure and holds significant promise for rapid heart failure detection. This paper discusses signal processing and diagnostic model techniques for the rapid diagnosis of AHF. The average SNR of heart sounds reached 7.8 dB. The models successfully achieve effective feature learning and effective loss convergence. DenseHF-Net stands out as the top-performing model in heart failure diagnosis, achieving an accuracy of 92.60\%. Both two auscultation strategies can meet the requirements for emergency vehicles and hospital rooms. Future research will focus on collecting multi-center AHF data for model training, aiming to achieve better generalization performance. Simultaneously, we will actively promote clinical testing and assessment to validate its practicality and explore its clinical emergency application value.
